# monjur00.github.io

This repo contains the source for my GitHub Pages site (portfolio + blog).  
Built with Jekyll + the `minima` theme â€” content is written in Markdown.

To contribute:
- Add pages at the repo root (`about.md`, `projects.md`, etc)
- Add blog posts in `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Push to `main` and GitHub Pages will publish the site.
